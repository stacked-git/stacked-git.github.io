stg-import - Import patches to stack

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg import' [OPTIONS] <diff-path>
'stg import' [OPTIONS] -m [<mail-path>|<Maildir-path>]
'stg import' [OPTIONS] -M [<mbox-path>]
'stg import' [OPTIONS] -S [<series-path>]
'stg import' [OPTIONS] -u <diff-url>
'stg import' [OPTIONS] -u -m <mail-url>
'stg import' [OPTIONS] -u -M <mbox-url>
'stg import' [OPTIONS] -u -S <series-url>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Import patches from various sources to the stack.

The simplest usage is to import a diff/patch file into the stack from a local
file. By default, the file name is used as the patch name, but this can be
overridden with '--name'. The patch can either be a normal file with the
description at the top, or it can have standard mail format. The "Subject",
"From", and "Date" headers will be used for the imported patch's author details.

Patches may also be imported from a mail file (-m/--mail), an mbox (-M/--mbox),
or a series (-S/--series). Furthermore, the -u/--url option allows the patches
source to be fetched from a url instead of from a local file.

If a patch does not apply cleanly import is aborted unless '--reject' is
specified, in which case it will apply to the work tree the parts of the patch
that are  applicable, leave the rejected hunks in corresponding *.rej files,
and add an empty patch to the stack.

The patch description must be separated from the diff with a "---" line.
